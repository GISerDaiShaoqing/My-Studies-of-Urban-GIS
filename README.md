Some code of my studies about Urban(based on R, Matlab, Python, CGA and so on).

## 1.The visualization of OLS in ArcGIS(for R)

## 2.AQI&Search Index in Beijing(for R)
It's my classmate's homework with my help. The homework is about the relationship between AQI and "Baidu" Search Index in Beijing. In 2015, Prof.Liu, who comes from Peking University published a paper "Social Sensing: A New Approach to Understanding Our Socioeconomic Environments". The data in homework is typical data of social sensing. I think it's very interesting.

## 3.Spatial visualization demo in folium (for Python)
Some spatial visualization demo in folium.
